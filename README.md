This coding challenge took me a while to figure out. My original whiteboard solution was close but i didnt check for nagitive numbers. I later ran into an issue with my brute force solution taking longer than 12000ms. I had a really hard time figuring this out because I broke the number one rule of programing "never assume"

This Kata was an easy one to figure out. My white board solution had two errors in it where I missed up some logic itn the main if statment. I like my solution but i feel like the use of a switch statment would have bin better than my if else statments. Something that need to work on is setting a time limit for white boarding.
